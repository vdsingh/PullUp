# PullUp
Winner of HackUMass IX's Best Mobile App and Best Use of Google Cloud!

PullUp is a location based study group locator that allows UMass students to find and create public study group sessions for the classes that they're in.

Built using Xcode and Swift. Uses MapKit as well as Firebase Realtime Database.

Vision:
- Add a chat feature that allows users looking for groups to communicate with those that have created them.
- Class-wide chats for students to communicate without needing to form study groups

In Progress:
- Passwordless email authentication (using Firebase's dynamic links) to ensure that users are UMass students in order to protect the safety and privacy of students.
